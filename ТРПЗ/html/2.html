	The electrical conductivity (σ in units of S m-1
) of an electrolyte is determined by the concentration and mobility of
its ions. Therefore, the electrical conductivity of the cell
interior should provide information about the state of the
ions within the cell, i.e., whether or not they are free moving or bound by ion exchanger mechanisms to components
of the cytoplasm such as proteins. It is a key measurement
for dielectric studies on cells. One of the most thoroughly
investigated cells is the red blood cell of mammals. This
cell exhibits a simple architecture, and its composition of
proteins and lipids is well known. Pauly and Schwan,
(1966) measured the internal conductivity of erythrocytes
and found a value of 0.518 S m-1 at 25 o
C (σ25 = 0.518 S m1
). They concluded that the internal conductivity is largely
due to the inorganic ionic content composed primarily of
K+, Na+, Mg++, Cl-
, and HCO3
- whose concentrations are
relatively easy to measure experimentally. The concentration of ions of haemoglobin due to their net charge was reported to be +45 mmol charge/l (cell H2O) from a total
concentration of haemoglobin of 7 mM (cell H2O) and so
the mean effective +ve charge per haemoglobin molecule
was +6.4 (Pauly and Schwan, 1966). The calculation of cytoplasmic conductivity from the ionic concentration of ions
present in the cytoplasm multiplied by their limiting ionic
conductance according to Kohlrausch’s law gave a value
of σ = 1.45 S m-1 which is 2.7 times higher than that obtained from experimental measurements by Pauly and
Schwan, (1966) (σ25 = 0.518 S m-1
). They concluded that
the discrepancy between ideal specific conductivity and the
measured value was due to the ionic mobility being hindered by cytoplasmic viscosity (Pauly and Schwan, 1966).
However, since most mammalian cells regulate their volumes, after the initial passive swelling (stomatocytogenic)
or shrinking (echinocytogenic) as a result of changes in the
bathing electrolyte and/or temperature, cells usually return
to a near-normal volume (Glaser, 1979). Red blood cells
quickly change their cell volumes because water moves
quickly into them through water channel proteins called aquaporins which do not allow charged ions to pass through
them (Murata et al., 2000). Several mechanisms are involved
in the slower process of adjusting their cell volume back to
normal, in most cases involving the loss and gain of K+ and
Cl- and to a lesser extent Na+(Glaser, 1979; Bernhardt, 1991;
Parker, 1993; O’Neill, 1999). A perturbation of cell volume
will certainly disturb the concentration of ions present in
the cytoplasm as described by Glaser and Donath, (1984)
and consequently cause the cytoplasmic conductivity to
shift from the normal physiological state.
In this investigation, the cytoplasmic conductivity of human red blood cells (HRBCs) at different temperatures was
observed. The cell volumes and cell water contents in the
cells were measured experimentally. The cytoplasmic conductivity (σc ) was calculated according to the Debye -
Hückel – Onsager equation combined with Walden’s rule
(Laidler and Meiser, 1995) and its temperature coefficient
was then estimated.

<p><i><b>Red blood cells</i></b></p>
HRBCs were obtained from the blood bank (Suratthani
Hospital, Thailand) and used within 3 days. The cells were
first separated from the blood plasma by centrifugation at
2000 g for 8 min. The supernatant plasma and buffy coat
was removed. The sedimented cells were used for the
experiments.
<p><i><b>Preparation of the cell suspension</i></b></p>
A 157 mM NaCl solution (300 mOsmol kg-1
) containing 1
mM Sodium Phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) was used to
resuspend the cells and the conductivity of the suspending
medium was adjusted to a conductivity of 1.48 S m-1
. The
standard conductivity of the bathing electrolyte
suspensions at 20o
C (σ20) was measured in the temperature
compensation mode (σ20 = σΤ(1−0.0214(Τ−20)), where
σΤ is the measured conductance at temperature T (o
C) in a
constant temperature bath using a conductivity meter
(Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland).
<p><i><b>Volume experiments</i></b></p>
The haematocrit volume (Hct) of the red-cell sediment was
determined in haematocrit-capillaries by centrifugation at
10000 g for 8 min (Cence, China). From the Hct, the
amount of measuring solution was calculated that was
needed for the dilution of 50 µl of the sedimented cells to
a final cell concentration of 10% (v/v). The cells were incubated in the measuring solution for 5 min and the Hct of
the suspensions were determined by haematocrit-centrifugation at 10000 g for 8 min. In parallel, the cell number
was microscopically determined using a standard haemocytometer (Improved Neubauer). From the cell count and
the Hct after 5 min in suspended solutions, the mean cell

volume (MCV) was determined following standard clinical
methods (Gedde andHuestis, 1979; Harris, 1984; Sudrisi, 2009;
Glaser, 2000). A trapped water volume correction constant
of 3% was assumed in all Hct calculations (Gedde and Huestis, 1979).
<p><i><b>Determination of cell water</i></b></p>
Red blood cells in a standard 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube were
spun down (10 000g) after 5 min of suspension in the
experimental medium. 300 µl of the packed cell volume
was then pipetted into a pre-weighed test tube (Gedde and
Huestis, 1979; Harris, 1984; Sudrisi, 2009). In parallel, the Hct
was determined experimentally. The tube was weighed
before and after drying at 80 °C for 24 hours. The cell
waterdetermination (Wc)was calculated from the wetted
cells weight (Wt) and dried cells weightas (Wd) as follows
(Harris, 1984)

m3 (± SE, n = 6).
<p><i><b>Cytoplasmic conductivity</i></b></p>
A Plot of calculated cytoplasmic conductivities over a
range of temperatures is shown in Figure 2.The data were
fitted to an exponential relation using non-linear least
squares methods and the asymptotic errors of the fitted
parameters calculated by matrix inversion. A temperature
coefficient value of k = 0.06239 ± 0.00202 (± SE, n = 24)
was obtained (Figure 2). The intracellular conductivities
increased by a factor of 1.866 ± 0.0377 (± SE) for every
increase in temperature of 10o
C and hence the Q10 of
cytoplasmic conductivity vs. temperature is a typical value
of ≈ 2 found in many biological systems (Glaser, 2000;
Nobel, 2009).
