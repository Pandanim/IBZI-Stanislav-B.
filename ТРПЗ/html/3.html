<p><i><b>Cell volume</i></b></p>
The data set of volume changes as well as water content of
HRBCs after suspension for 5 min in the measuring
solutions. The changes in cell water were found to be
proportional to volume changes: the HRBC volume
increases with rising of temperature. To further
characterize the nature of the volume changes depending
on temperature, the data on cell volume change were
plotted over a range of experimental temperatures (Figure
1) and fitted to the Arrhenius-relation as a suitable model
(Glaser, 2000).

<p><i><b>Cytoplasmic conductivity</i></b></p>
A Plot of calculated cytoplasmic conductivities over a
range of temperatures is shown in Figure 2.The data were
fitted to an exponential relation using non-linear least
squares methods and the asymptotic errors of the fitted
parameters calculated by matrix inversion. A temperature
coefficient value of k = 0.06239 ± 0.00202 (± SE, n = 24)
was obtained (Figure 2). The intracellular conductivities
increased by a factor of 1.866 ± 0.0377 (± SE) for every
increase in temperature of 10o
C and hence the Q10 of
cytoplasmic conductivity vs. temperature is a typical value
of ≈ 2 found in many biological systems (Glaser, 2000;
Nobel, 2009).

<p><i><b>Cell volume</i></b></p>
The activation energy obtained from the fit in Figure 1
indicates the electrical energy required to provide a driving
force for net movements of ions across the membrane
plotted over the ionic concentrations of the suspending
solution. Highly negative activation energy means there is
a high ionic concentration difference across the cell
membrane. The fits using the direct non-linear and logtransform methods both give an activation energy of about
-2.4 kJ mol-1
. This means that there was little or no ionic
concentration difference across the membrane and hence
change in cell volume depends only on temperature. There
are two major reasons for an influence of temperature on
water influx. The first is an alteration of external
hydrostatic pressure as predicted by the Van’t Hoff
relation. The hydrostatic pressure depends strongly on
temperature and increases when the temperature is raised.
The increase in external hydrostatic pressure will destroy
the balance of the pressures between the two sides of the
membrane. To re-balance the system, water moves down
its chemical potential gradient and enters to the cell. The 
cell swells. Secondly, increase in temperature will decrease
the viscosity of external medium and consequently
increase in the hydraulic conductivity, Lp, which is a
parameter determined by the viscosity of the fluid (η) and
membrane characteristics including the membrane pore of
radius (r), pore number (n m-2
), membrane thickness (δ),
which are related as follows (Sperelakis,1995):

The experimentally measured HRBC conductivity value
at 25 o
C (σ25 = 0.5566 ± 0.0146 S m-1
, ± SE, n = 4) shown
in Fig. 2 agrees very well with the value of σ25 ≈ 0.5 to
0.6 S m-1 found experimentally in other studies on red
blood cells using quite different methods(Seidlet al., 1999;
Fuhr et al., 1986; Sudsiri, 2002; Krupa and Terlecki, 1976;
Asami, 1992) and is similar to theoretical estimates by
Glaser and Donath (1984). For comparison, the
conductivities of the cytoplasm of bacteria, plant
protoplasts and yeast cells using dielectric methods have
been reported to vary from 0.1 to 1.2 S m-1 at 25o
C and so
the conductivity of red blood cells appears to be
representative for the cytoplasm of most cells (Hölzel and
Lamprecht, 1992, 1997; Suehiro et al., 2003) despite the
HRBC having a large amount of haemoglobin inside the
cell which might lead to the belief that its conductivity
would be unrepresentative. Of more physiological
relevance is the HRBC conductivity at 37o
C; σ37 = 1.156
± 0.0188 S m-1 (± SE, n = 4) in the present study which is
very nearly twice the value found at the standard
measuring temperature of 25 o
C. Conductivity
information on HRBC cells is useful information because
the conductivities of most cells are not practically
measureable whereas the conductivity of the HRBC is
easily measured by very simple techniques and by more
than one method.
